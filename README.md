# LR(1) Parser

This project implements an LR(1) parser, which is a type of deterministic parser used for syntax analysis in compilers. The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

## Project Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the frontend code, which includes the user interface and client-side logic.
- `backend/`: Contains the backend code, which includes the server-side logic and the core parsing algorithm.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using modern web technologies and frameworks. It provides an interface for users to input their grammar and view the parsing results.

### Key Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting grammar rules.
- Visualization of the parsing process.
- Error handling and feedback for invalid inputs.

### .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file in the `frontend` directory includes rules to ignore:

- Logs
- Node modules
- Build directories
- Environment files
- Editor directories and files
- Various cache and output files

## Backend

The backend is responsible for processing the input grammar and performing the LR(1) parsing. It is built using Python and includes the core parsing algorithm.

### Key Features

- Efficient LR(1) parsing algorithm.
- API endpoints for interacting with the frontend.
- Detailed error messages and debugging information.

### .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file in the `backend` directory includes rules to ignore:

- Byte-compiled and optimized files
- Distribution and packaging directories
- Unit test and coverage reports
- Environment directories and files
- Various cache and output files

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` and `backend` directories and install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the backend server and the frontend development server.
